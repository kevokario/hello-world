Hello gihub, I am an intern at Quest website developers & Designers and today i am going to earn about you.
So far i have learned what a repository(a project on gihub) is and how to create a repository. 
I have also learned about branches(Different versions of your project files) and how to make them. 
This is a branch readme-edits.
